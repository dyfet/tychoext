# Contributing to this project

This project is publicly licensed and will have a public home project on
https://www.github.com/tychosoft. This will an issue tracker where people can
submit public bug reports, a wiki for hosting project documentation, and a
public git repo.

Given that I may be without connectivity at times the public git repo is really
more a publication point and stable survivable public location I will use for
packaging.

## CI Integration

At some point Github actions will be used for public ci integration. There are
only a few types of ci actions I may use. One will be to evaluate merge
requests, and if this is broken hopefully whomever submits a merge request can
fix it. Others I may add over time for public things that need to be done for a
new tagged release.

## Documentation

All project documentation should be available in markdown files included with
the project and accessible from the repo.

## Issues

The support ticket system can be used for bug requests, discussion items, or
any kind of inquiry at all. It's contents are fully public. It also is entirely
separate from my own internal development ticketing.

## Patches

Patches may be submitted and attached to an issue in the issue tracker or sent
by email. They should be provided in unified diffs. All code contributions must
be held in copyright under Tycho Softworks for now, which may require a
copyright assignment form. This is a new requirement since all current code
already is exclusively copyrighted by Tycho Softworks as it had only been
worked on by me alone, but this may change if there is active participation.

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other.

Don't be the asshole.
